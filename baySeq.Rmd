This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
source("http://stevenbsmith.net/source/load_R_enviornment_vars.R")
library(baySeq)
## For multiple cores. Set cl <- NULL if snow cant be used
library(snow)
cl <- makeCluster(4, "SOCK")

```
Load simulated data, as per vinette, although I should play with other data set used in DEseq to see how it compares
```{r}
data(simData)
simData[1:10,] ## as per vinette. The data are simulated such that the first hundred counts show differential expression between the first five libraries and the second five libraries
replicates <- c("simA", "simA", "simA", "simA", "simA","simB", "simB", "simB", "simB", "simB")
groups <- list(NDE = c(1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1),DE = c(1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2))
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
